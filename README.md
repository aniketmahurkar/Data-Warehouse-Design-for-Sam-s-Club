# Data-Warehouse-Design-for-Sam-s-Club
The purpose of this document is to share our insights and findings on the return fraud and abuse for the Sam’s Club retail stores. We aim to identify the return frauds due to external and internal parameters that have affected the Sam’s Club retail stores and reduce these frauds by initiating controls in place. We have used Business Intelligence in performing analysis that will ensure prevention of return frauds.

The document can also be used as a white paper by any retail player focusing on mitigating the losses due to return frauds and thereby design their data warehouse for performing the descriptive analysis.
